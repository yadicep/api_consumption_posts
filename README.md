# **FETCH POSTS FROM AN API**

This project demonstrates the ability to fetch and display data from an API while managing errors effectively. Using `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`, users can retrieve example posts by clicking a button. The posts are displayed dynamically in a styled HTML list, showcasing asynchronous programming techniques with `async-await` and error handling with `try-catch`.

## **Technologies Used**
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6)**
- **Fetch API**


## **Features**
- **API Integration**: Consumes data from the `JSONPlaceholder` API, retrieving posts dynamically.
- **Async-Await for Requests**: Ensures non-blocking calls and efficient data retrieval.
- **Error Handling**: Implements `try-catch` blocks to handle potential errors during API requests.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Displays fetched posts in an unordered HTML list for better readability.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Fetches posts with a single button click.
